## Description

In Minneapolis, all of the light rail stations have displays showing the estimates for when the next two trains will show up. The program shown here brings this vital information to the comfort of your own home so you don't need to wait out in the cold. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, mouse, monitor, WiFi connection, and patience.
